## Website Goal

    This web app is aimed at beginner and junior coders who are eager to grow their skills and connect with others. After logging in, users can explore blog posts, browse a curated list of useful coding resources, and check out the merchandise page. It’s fully responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

    The goal is to create a welcoming space where junior developers can share ideas, support each other, and grow together in their coding journey — while also making the most of Python throughout the development process. The app is built using Flask, with Flask-WTF for form handling and validation, and shelve (via a custom DumbShelf wrapper) for lightweight data persistence.
